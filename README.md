# passwordGenerator-Java
Hey, I would like to publish my first small project. It's a password generator that offers 3 modes to choose from. You can customize your password or choose the default settings from the modes. Have fun ;D


How to use this programm?
First you have to install JDK (at least version 8). Then you can navigate in the terminal to the file path where you put the Password.java file. From there you have to compile the programme in the terminal with: "javac Password.java" and then call it with "java Password". Then everything should explain itself.
